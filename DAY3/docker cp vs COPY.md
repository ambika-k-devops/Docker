## docker CP vs docker COPY differece how to explain inter in simple words

Here's a **simple explanation** to explain the difference between `docker cp` and `COPY` in an interview:

---

### 🔹 `docker cp`:

* It is a **Docker CLI command**.
* Used to **copy files between your host machine and a running container**.
* Works **after** the container is already running.

**Example**:

```bash
docker cp myfile.txt container_name:/app/
```

➡️ This copies `myfile.txt` into the `/app` folder inside the running container.

---

### 🔹 `COPY`:

* It is a **Dockerfile instruction**.
* Used to **copy files from your host machine into the image** during the image build process.
* Works **while building the image**.

**Example**:

```Dockerfile
COPY myfile.txt /app/
```

➡️ This copies `myfile.txt` into `/app/` folder **in the image** being built.

### 🔸 Key Differences:

| Feature     | `docker cp`                          | `COPY`                           |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| When used?  | After container is running           | While building Docker image      |
| Where used? | Command Line                         | Inside Dockerfile                |
| Use case    | Transfer files into/out of container | Add files to image at build time |
| Target      | Running container                    | Docker image                     |

### 🎯 One-Line Summary (for interviews):

> "`docker cp` is used to copy files **to/from a running container**, while `COPY` is used in a Dockerfile to add files to the **image during build**."
