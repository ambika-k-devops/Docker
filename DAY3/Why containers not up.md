# why container does not up, what are the possibel reasons give me simple way

Here are **simple and common reasons** why a **container does not start (does not come up)**:

---

### 🔧 **1. Image not found**

* **Reason**: Image name is wrong or not present locally.
* **Fix**: Check image name/tag, use `docker pull` if needed.

```bash
docker run myapp:latest   ❌ (image may not exist)
```

---

### 🐳 **2. Error in Dockerfile or CMD/ENTRYPOINT**

* **Reason**: The command to run inside the container fails.
* **Fix**: Check Dockerfile `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT`, or the script it's running.

---

### 📁 **3. Missing Files or Config**

* **Reason**: File not found inside the container (e.g., `config.json`).
* **Fix**: Make sure required files are copied or mounted correctly.

---

### 🔒 **4. Port already in use**

* **Reason**: Host port is already occupied by another process.
* **Fix**: Use a different port with `-p`.

```bash
docker run -p 8080:80 myapp   ✅
```

---

### 🔄 **5. Restarting due to Crash (CrashLoop)**

* **Reason**: Container starts but immediately crashes due to error.
* **Fix**: Check logs.

```bash
docker logs <container-id>
```

---

### 🧪 **6. Health check failure**

* **Reason**: Container keeps failing health checks and marked as unhealthy.
* **Fix**: Fix health check command or give container time to initialize.

---

### ⚠️ **7. Environment variables missing**

* **Reason**: Required env vars not set, causing app to crash.
* **Fix**: Pass them using `-e`.

```bash
docker run -e DB_HOST=db ... myapp
```

---

### 🔄 **8. Volume Mount Errors**

* **Reason**: Mounting volume fails due to incorrect path.
* **Fix**: Check `-v` path and permissions.

---

### 🔧 **9. Not enough resources (memory/CPU)**

* **Reason**: Host doesn't have enough memory/CPU.
* **Fix**: Free up system resources or adjust limits.

---

### 📄 **10. Permissions or access issues**

* **Reason**: App inside container doesn't have permission to access files or ports.
* **Fix**: Use correct user or adjust permissions.

---

If you’re not sure what went wrong, run:

```bash
docker logs <container-id>
```

To see the actual error.
